This should be implemented at '/v1/destroy'.

Implement proper, detailed logging.

Deployment docs exist for Python apps in general, but this project could
probably use a few examples for Supervisor, Nginx, and HAProxy. In addition,
we should better document deployment on Marathon and HAProxy using the
'marathon-haproxy-bridge' script provided by Mesosphere.

There is no Redis error handling; the function always returns True.
